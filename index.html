        <h2>Hi, I'm Stephen.</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal digital portfolio!</p>
        <p>Currently working as an accountant, I am expanding my skillset and diving into the world of software development. Right now I am undertaking Codecademy's full-stack developer course and I am about 20% of the way through, having currently only studied front-end languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In time this digital portfolio will become a space where I showcase my software development projects, but for the time being my portfolio consists of this website only! So stay tuned, exciting things are coming soon!</p>
